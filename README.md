# arp-flooding

ARP Flooding is an attack caused by flooding packets to the CPU
of the target device.

**Working of the ARP Flooding Attack:**

  ● For a system to be attacked, both the victim and the attacker
should be connected to the same network.

  ● Then the attacker will be continuously sending ARP request
packets to the victim.

  ● This creates a high volume Network Traffic to the victim
system, thus reducing the device performance.


**ARP Flooding Consequences:**
1. Device performance gets reduced
2. Unable to connect to the other devices in a network
3. Very high volume of Network Traffic to the system
4. Decrease in the Internet speed
